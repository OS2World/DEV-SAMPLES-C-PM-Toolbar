DEV-SAMPLES-CPLUSPLUS-Toolbar
=============================

This sample program implements two menu bars: a standard action bar and a "toolbar". The toolbar consists of "buttons" that can be pressed. Currently the buttons take no actions.       The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate subclassing the frame window to add frame controls.
